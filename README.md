# updater

A Project for Updating Desktop Flutter Apps

## Getting Started

Create an account and login. Create a new App with Mac location.
This will be of the type:
`/Applications/My App.app`

Updater can replace just the binary file for Mac apps so that the whole app does not need to be updated.

Windows will need to create and msi file and run it.
